## Introduction

This project aims at showing various insights of Indian Elections - 2024. Using Jupyter Notebook, Python and Power BI the following has been made possible. Through this project we can see how to scrap data from webpage and export csv files. 
## Project Overview 

The project involves the following steps:

- scrap data from the given website.
- convert the data into respective csv files.
- use the csv files to build 10 key insights from using Power BI.
- for reference I have also taken a dataset available on the interent and used it in visualization too.


## Data Source




Download all the necessary CSV files from [All Dataset folder](all-dataset) 

## Resources


The following resources were used in the development of this project:

## Usage

To get started with this project, please follow the steps listed below:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Scrap the necessary tables from the website.
3. Using Pandas create tables and export them as csv. (These exported files are the dataset that we will use for visualizations)
4. Using Power BI create different charts and bar graphs showing key insights of this project.






### Step 1: Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ts5578/election-result.git  
```

### Step 2: Scrap data from the website

As you can see in the jupyter notebook using Python and Pandas data was scrapped from the given website and converted into tables 

### Step 3: Using Power BI

Now importing the dataset that we created to Power BI, we start working on making various different charts and bar graph to show the insights.

### Step 4: Publish the Power BI page

Finally after visualizing and creating various insights we can publish it and export it as a pdf or ppt, as we require.




### Step 5: Results

I have added my report pdf to this github repository, you can visit it here.

## Conclusion

This project provides hands-on experience in using Python to scrap data from real website and convert it into a datset. This dataset is later on used for visualization and learning key insights using Power BI. Finally you can see all the key insights that I created for this project [here](parliamentary-constituency).
